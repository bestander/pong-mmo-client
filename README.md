jamjs-example
=============

This is a working example of an AMD javascript module that can serve as a template for a production javascript front end module deployed to JAM repository.
This is merely an addition to http://jamjs.org/docs and http://requirejs.org/docs/start.html.

TODO:
- format this text
- figure out how this package can be deployed to JAM repository
